# SwiftBot-MasterMind-Game
Interactive colour-based MasterMind game built in Java using the SwiftBot robot API , using the camera to detect the colours and play the game against a robot by guessing the right answer.
Overview
An interactive guessing game built using the SwiftBot robot and Java. The robot detects colour cards via its camera and provides LED feedback for correct or incorrect guesses. Designed as part of a Year 1 Brunel University coursework project.

Features
Real-time colour detection using SwiftBot’s camera API.
Random colour pattern generation per round.
Score tracking, LED celebration animations, and loss indicators.
Bilingual interface (English–Albanian).
Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and API integration.
